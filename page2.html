    <p>The dabbling duck is a subfamily of the family Anatidae. This group of ducks has been so named because its 
        members feed mainly on vegetable matter by upending on the water surface, or grazing, and only rarely 
        diving. These are mostly gregarious ducks of freshwater or estuaries. These birds are strong fliers 
        and northernspecies are highly migratory.</p>
